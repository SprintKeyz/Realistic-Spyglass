# Realistic-Spyglass
A minecraft plugin that makes you go blind when you look at the sun through a spyglass, config and commands included!

You'd think that if you magnify the sun's energy right into your eye, you'd go blind at least for a bit, right? Despite minecraft not being realistic, this adds some cool functionality to the game and should work decently well.

Minecraft Versions: 1.17 (the only tested version atm)

There are stil some issues though, and the tracking of the sun may not be perfect (I have to approximate it's location given time of day). I hope to update it and make more precise tracking, but it's still not bad.

If you enjoy this plugin and want to support me, consider subscribing on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/c/sprintkeyz)! This plugin took hours to make, so i'd appreciate it <3

DISCLAIMER: DO NOT LOOK AT THE SUN IN REAL LIFE! IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR VISION!
